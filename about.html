            <h3>road ahead</h3>

            <p class="about-card--details">
              Rural consumption has increased, led by a combination of
              increasing income and higher aspiration levels. There is an
              increased demand for branded products in rural India. On the other
              hand, with the share of the unorganised market in the FMCG sector
              falling, the organised sector growth is expected to rise with an
              increased level of brand consciousness, augmented by the growth in
              modern retail. Another major factor propelling the demand for food
              services in India is the growing youth population, primarily in
              urban regions. India has a large base of young consumers who form
              most of the workforce, and due to time constraints, barely get
              time for cooking.
